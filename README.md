# LIGO koans

# Prerequisites

## Remote execution

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ligolang/ligo-koans)

## Local execution

Please install this software first on your machine or use online alternative : 

- [ ] [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) : as text editor
- [ ] [ligo](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/installation/) : high level language that's transpile to michelson low level language and provide lot of development support for Tezos
- [ ] make:`sudo apt install make`

Then after you can perform a git clone of `https://github.com/ligolang/ligo-koans`

# What's a Koan

A koans are essentially a simple problem where programmer is asked to 
complete the code. And this is done thanks to unit testing.

## Howto ?

The koans are in files from k01 to k16 in the lib directory. Each one can be executed independantly thanks to the `make` command:

```sh
jsligo-koans ➤ make k01
[Testing] test/k01.jsligo

Test failed with "Should return \"Hello\""
Trace:
File "test/../lib/common/todo.jsligo", line 2, characters 15-32:

File "test/../lib/k01_native_types.jsligo", line 5, characters 4-37 ,
File "test/k01.jsligo", line 4, characters 28-40
make: *** [k01] Error 
```

Open the file `k01_native_types` and fix the code. For instance the previous one can be solved replacing the `K.todo(...)` by the response.

### Before

```javascript
export const hello = () : string => 
    K.todo("Should return \"Hello\"");
```

#### After

```javascript
export const hello = () : string => 
    "Hello";
```

```sh
jsligo-koans ➤ make k01
[Testing] test/k01.jsligo
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = "Hello"})

Test failed with "Should return 1"
Trace:
File "test/../lib/common/todo.jsligo", line 2, characters 15-32:

File "test/../lib/k01_native_types.jsligo", line 9, characters 4-29 ,
File "test/k01.jsligo", line 5, characters 28-38
make: *** [k01] Error 1
```

Then solves each exercise step by step and finally for k01 you should 
have the following execution trace.

```
jsligo-koans ➤ make all
[Testing] test/k01.jsligo
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = "Hello"})
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = 1})
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = 1n})
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = 1000000mutez})
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = true})
("[SUCCESS]" , {expected = 2n})
```

Once `k01` is solved you can do the same for`k02`, `k03`, ..., `k15` and finally `k16`. Each Koan covers a
specific topic of the language. Finally, `k17` introduces polymorphism.
